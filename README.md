How to Play
1. Starting the Game
Type 1 to play the game and 0 to exit the game
When the cards are displayed, a grid of cards with numbers hidden behind them.
Each card is marked with a default value (e.g., “02x2” for a 2x2 expression).
The target product is displayed somewhere on the screen, e.g., "Target: 20."
2. Choosing Cards
Select two cards by entering the coordinates of row and column (rows: 1 – 4, columns: A – D). Ex: A4, C2
Once a card is selected, it will show its number or expression.
If the two selected cards multiply to the target product, they will be revealed, and you don’t need to check them again.
If the numbers do not match, they will be hidden again.
3. Matching the Cards
The game tracks which cards have been matched (those with a leading '1' in their first byte).
Once a pair matches, they will be marked and won’t need to be checked again.
Keep selecting pairs until all matching pairs are found.
4. Game End
The game ends when all pairs are matched, and the board is completely revealed.
The game will terminate after all the matching pairs are found.
